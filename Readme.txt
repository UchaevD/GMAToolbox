This toolbox implements the following author's algorithms:
 - generalized multifractal image analysis [1];
 - improving the quality of grayscale images (adjustment of sharpness, contrast and brightness) [2, 3];
 - calculation of multifractal features for grayscale images [4-6];

This toolbox implements many methods for calculating local and global multifractal characteristics of images. Using this toolbox, you can comfortably solve such problems as the classification of hyperspectral images and grayscale image contrasting.
